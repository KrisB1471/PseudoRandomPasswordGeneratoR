# PseudoRandomPasswordGeneratoR

For the moment, the generator is but a mere functional R Markdown script that can be run &/ modified to generate pseudo-random password strings. 
The next step will be to use R Shiny to add interactivity, so that all password parameters (i.e., seed, symbols, symbol probabilities, number & length of passwords, etc.), 
can be easily customized and the passwords generated with the click of a button. 
The final step will be to create a fully functional secure password manager with a secured database to store generated passwords for different online accounts.
